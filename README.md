# Love Running

In this section, you will include one or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project. Essentially, this part is your sales pitch. At this stage, you should have a name for your project so use it! Don’t introduce the project as a Portfolio project for the diploma. In this section, describe what the project hopes to accomplish, who it is intended to target and how it will be useful to the target audience. 

For example; Love Running is a site that hopes to help keep people motivated to meet up for runs on a regular basis in Dublin, Ireland. The site will be targeted toward runners who are looking for a way to socialise and keep themselves fit. Love Running will be useful for runners to see exactly when and where they should be to join the running club.

## Testing 

## Responsiveness

    This part of the testing was done in Lighthouse throughout the project to ensure the content of each page remained fully responsive and 100% visible after each amendment. The testing tool was set to the most common Samsung, Apple and Google products to cover the full range of screens from the smallest being the Galaxy fold Z 5 (344px) to a curved 27" external monitor.

  ### Functionality

  Features checked during testing included checking:

    Nav Bar

      - that up until screens width 768px (tablets and larger mobiles) the menu is hidden in the burger icon in the upper left corner and expands and collaps when clicked

      - that upon expanding the menu the solid line indicating the part of the page the user is currently on is visible under the correct active menu item

      - that from screen width 768px onwards the nav bar is spread out and adjusts automatically to take up the available space and the features of a solid line under the menu item and the menu items changing colours is inherited

      - that the hyperlink linked to each each menu item and the logo is working as expected and connect to the correct parts of the webpage


    Homepage

      - that the hero image adjusts proportional to the screen size and is not distorted on either screen
      - that content and image in the middle section adjust proprotional to the screen size, the conetent remains fully visible and readable at all times
      - that the image grid adjusts to the screen size with all images staying visible and are not distorted on either screen
      - that the social icons are clickable and embedded the hyperlinks open up to a new page


    Gallery

      - that all images adjust proportionally to the screen size and are spread out to fill the additional space on larger screens


    Sign form

    - that the fields mandatory to fill in are working as expected so the user cannot submit an incorrect or incomplete form
